Since it was running in the cloud, it also meant that I could access blocked websites with <code>curl</code> and other CLI tools. After seeing  <code>3kh0/DesktopOnCodespaces</code> (its been disabled for policy violation), I found it was possible to run a whole desktop on Codespaces and Gitpod. I looked into this and found it was using KasmVNC. After a bit of code, I found it was possible to run a simple firefox browser.</p> <p>Simply open the repo in gitpod. After it has finished loading you should get a port forwarding popup. Click open in browser and enjoy your unblocked browser!</p>"},{"location":"related-projects/schooldocs/","title":"SchoolDocs","text":"<p>Click Here</p>"}]}
