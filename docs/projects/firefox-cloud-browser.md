Ever since I found out about [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/), I was amazed that you could run a cloud ide on a *school* chromebook. Since it was running in the cloud, it also meant that I could access blocked websites with `curl` and other CLI tools. After seeing :fontawesome-brands-github: `3kh0/DesktopOnCodespaces` (its been disabled for policy violation), I found it was possible to run a whole desktop on Codespaces and Gitpod. I looked into this and found it was using [KasmVNC](https://kasmweb.com/kasmvnc). After a bit of code, I found it was possible to run a simple firefox browser.

Simply [open the repo in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Contentgiver/Firefox-CloudBrowser). After it has finished loading you should get a port forwarding popup. Click open in browser and enjoy your unblocked browser!
