# Host a website (that's unblocked)

Hosting a static website on `github.io` (with github pages) means it is already unblocked. It is really simple to do this.

!!! tip

    name a file `index.html` to make it the homepage

1. Create an account on github
2. Create a new repo, name it whatever you like
3. Upload or create files
4. Go to settings > pages > select main branch > save
5. Wait about two minutes and then access your site with `[yourusername].github.io/[reponame]`
